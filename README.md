# 🚀 Deep Learning Second Assignment
- **Objective**: The goal of this project is to leverage **BERT** for text classification, improving model performance through effective training and evaluation techniques.


## 🌟 Features
- 🧠 Implementation of deep learning models
   - Fine-tuning a **pretrained BERT model**  
   - Using a custom classification head  
   - Handling input sequence padding and truncation  
- 🛠️ Data preprocessing
   - Tokenization using **BERT Tokenizer**  
- 📊 Model evaluation
   - Training the model with appropriate **loss functions and optimizers**  
   - Evaluating using **accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix**  
   - Visualizing loss and performance over epochs


## 📈 Model Evaluation
The notebook includes evaluation of the model(s) using the following metrics:
✅ Accuracy: 87%
🎯 F1-score: 88%
